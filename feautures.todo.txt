Fix first frames for guns to make them centered.
For SSG -  add muzzle into weapons sprites.
For brass knuckles there is a sound hitting metal in Brutal Doom I think.
Chainsaw - I'll probably add 2 versions - the one that shakes will be in "enchanced", and one that is still in vanilla.
The hardest part now is monsters - some sprites are not looking well in upscaled version.
Smooth animations for liquids(water, blood, e.t.c. )
x Bullet effects & casings for monsters;
write things that added in git into changes log & in here
