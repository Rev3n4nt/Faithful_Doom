## About Faithful Doom
Faithful Doom is a Doom & Doom 2 mod focused on enhancing the classic gameplay experience. Our main goal is to preserve the original Doom atmosphere while introducing Neural Upscaled Smooth animation sprites for weapons, items, and monsters. This project aims to double frame rates and pixel density without exceeding 2x resolution, ensuring that enhancements do not compromise the game's iconic feel.

- **Preservation of Classic Gameplay:** Faithful to the original Doom's style, with minor, optional improvements.
- **Compatibility:** Designed for ZDoom/GZDoom, not compatible with other ports like Zandronum or Brutal Doom.
