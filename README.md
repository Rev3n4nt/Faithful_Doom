Description :
Smooth enhanced Animations for Weapons and other sprites as addon for Doom Neural Upscale 2x mod.
Taken as a fork of "Beautiful Doom" & "Smooth Doom".
Mod is using original vanilla doom sprites & adding new inter-frame sprites which are closest to original.
Planned to add later: empty casings, bullet tracers, items, smooth water, monsters.
Mod is currently WIP. For now working only on weapons, later - more.

Public Service Announcements:
Original Doom faithfulness is the main goal, few additions will be toggable in options menu.
This is a Zdoom/GZdoom mod (use the latest version) & will NOT work with other ports such as Zandronum. Cross-port compatibility isn't planned. The mod is a PK3-file.
REQUIRED PORT: GZDoom 3.2.5 or higher.

PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS YOU FIND!

Optionally mod goes with HD mid-frames - FDoom*_HD.pk3.
